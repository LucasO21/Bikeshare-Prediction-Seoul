# Bikeshare-Prediction-Seoul

A machine learning project to predict hourly bike rentals in Seoul. The goal of the project was to see if I could produce a model with a better accuracy (MAE & RMSE) than the accuracy in [this](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22797254.2020.1725789) research paper that accompanies the dataset. Full article can be found [here](https://lokwudishu.com/blog/bike_rental_prediction/).

* Project Outcome: After 2 rounds of hyper-parameter tuning. The XGBOOST model produced RMSE that was better (lower) that the RMSE of the best performing model in the research paper. 

* Data Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand).

* Models Explored: Random Forest, XGBOOST, Cubist.

* Tools/Packages Used: R, Tidymodels.
